			<h2>Statement of the Problem</h2>
			<hr class="linenablue">
				<div class="pabigat">
			<p>Mental illness is prevalent among college students, yet a large proportion of those experiencing mental health problems do not seek or receive appropriate treatment. This gap is largely influenced by limited mental health awareness, insufficient knowledge of available campus resources, and persistent stigma associated with mental illness. Despite the growing implementation of mental health awareness campaigns and educational programs in higher education institutions, the specific impact of formal mental health education on students’ awareness, beliefs, and stigmatic attitudes remains inadequately studied. In particular, there is a lack of empirical evidence examining whether structured academic courses focused on mental illness can effectively increase mental health awareness and reduce stigma among college students. Addressing this gap is essential to promote help-seeking behavior, improve student well-being, and support the development of effective mental health education initiatives on college campuses.</p>
