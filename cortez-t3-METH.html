            <h2>Methodology</h2><hr>
This study employed a retrospective cohort design, utilizing the OpenSAFELY-TPP platform to analyze a massive patient population across England between January 2018 and February 2023. The researchers tracked adult patients (aged 18–120) registered with TPP practices who were active users of any of the four major DOACs. For the primary analysis period of March 2022 to February 2023, the team extracted specific clinical data from electronic health records, including demographics, weight, serum creatinine, eGFR, and CrCl. The study focused on calculating the percentage of patients who had these essential metrics recorded and specifically analyzed patients with atrial fibrillation to determine if their DOAC dose was accurate, underdosed, or overdosed based on their recorded creatinine clearance (CrCl) levels as per national guidelines.        </div>
