            The researchers recommend that while AI shows significant potential for automating discharge documentation, future implementation must prioritize human oversight to mitigate patient safety risks and ensure the inclusion of nuanced clinical reasoning. To move beyond this initial feasibility stage, they advocate for larger-scale studies using real-world, anonymized patient data rather than mock vignettes, utilizing NHS-approved AI tools that can be safely integrated into existing electronic patient record (EPR) systems. Furthermore, they suggest that GPs should be actively involved in defining the content standards for these communications and that future research should explore the use of AI to generate simplified lay summaries to improve patient understanding and engagement in their own care.
