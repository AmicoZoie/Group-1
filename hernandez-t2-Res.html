			<p>Paired samples t test was performed to determine
whether there are significant differences between pretest and post-test for the sample of size N=82 who
took the psychology course. Table 1 shows the result of
paired samples t test between pre-test and post-test for
Beliefs Toward Mental Illness Scales (BTMI), Stigma 9
questionnaires (STIG-9), and 4 subfactors of the BTMI. The
BTMI has four subfactors and they are Dangerousness/
harm, Social Dysfunction, Incurability, and Embarrassment.
The first two rows of the table 1 show a significant difference
at ɑ=0.05 level between pre-test and post-test for BTMI
(p-value=0.041) and STIG-9 (p-value=0.036). It suggests
that students show improvement on belief and awareness
about mental health and decrease of stigma level related
to mental health after the mental health education. The t
value of the difference between pre-test and post-test is
2.077 (BTMI), and 2.127 (STIG-9), respectively, meaning
that the mean BTMI scores and the mean STIG-9 scores
were decreased after the mental health education. In the
questionnaire of the BTMI and the STIG-9, low BTMI scores
represents high mental health awareness, and low STIG 9 scores represents low stigmatic attitudes</p>
