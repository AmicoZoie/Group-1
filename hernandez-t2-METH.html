			<p><b>Participants and Procedures</b><br>
 Before recruitment began for this study, approval
was sought and received from the Internal Review Board
at Georgia Gwinnett College for using human subjects.
Students who took the Abnormal Psychology course were
recruited voluntarily, and 128 students participated in
the study. We analyzed 82 students who completed both
pre-test and post-test among total numbers. Students
enrolled in the Abnormal Psychology course learned
about the history of mental illness, studied various
mental disorders (symptoms, causes, treatments), and
learned about numerous models for understanding the
nature of mental illness. In addition, students took three
questionnaires twice, one at the beginning and one at the
end of the semester. We compared scores from two results
and examined whether mental health education improves
levels of awareness and reduces perceived stigma among
college students.
<b>Measurements</b><br>
 The instruments used in this study are the
Beliefs toward Mental Illness Scale (BTMI)44,45 and the
Stig-9 questionnaire (Stig-9)46, and the Demographic
Questionnaire. The Beliefs towards Mental Illness Scale
(BTMI) assesses the negative perception of mental health and how that may affect whether individuals seek
psychological help44,45. The BTMI has gained attention
among researchers interested in measuring stigma toward
psychological disorders13. In addition, BTMI assessed crosscultural differences in beliefs related to mental illness.</p>
