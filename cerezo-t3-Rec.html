			<h2>Methodology</h2>
			<hr class="linenablue">
        <p>The paper explicitly recommends:

Expand research to include the influence of the private sector, NGOs, and other institutions on sustainable practices (since the study focused only on local government actions).

Additional implied recommendations based on the results (but not necessarily verbatim) include:

Strengthen inclusivity and coverage of transportation and disaster readiness services across all barangays.

Enhance cooperation and policy coherence between national and local government programs to sustain achievements.

Boost community participation beyond government-led initiatives.
