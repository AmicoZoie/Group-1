            <h2>Methodology</h2><hr>
            The researchers created 25 case vignettes based on common medical scenarios, ensuring they contained all necessary clinical details while excluding real patient data. These vignettes were used to generate 50 discharge summaries: 25 were written by five junior doctors with Foundation Programme experience, and the other 25 were generated by ChatGPT using a standardized prompt with minimal formatting adjustments. To evaluate the results, five GPs performed a blinded review of 10 summaries each, judging whether they were AI-written and if they met professional standards for clinical practice. Finally, the summaries were objectively scored against 19 criteria from the National Prescribing Centre (NPC) dataset to measure adherence and analyzed by the OpenAI Text Classifier to see if the AI-generated content could be detected.
