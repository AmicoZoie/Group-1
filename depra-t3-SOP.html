			<h2>Statement of the Problem</h2>
			<hr class="linenablue">
<p> Microplastic pollution is a growing environmental concern because these tiny plastic particles are widespread in marine environments and can be ingested by filter‑feeding organisms like bivalves, which are important both ecologically and as a source of food and protein for humans.<br><br>Despite Chile being a major exporter of bivalves, there is limited information on the levels, characteristics, and distribution of microplastics in commercially valuable bivalve species and in the waters where bivalve aquaculture occurs, especially across areas with differing degrees of human disturbance.<br><br> This knowledge gap hinders effective assessment of environmental risk, potential impacts on aquaculture sustainability, seafood quality, and the development of monitoring or mitigation strategies for microplastic contamination in the aquaculture industry. </p>
