1. Study Area and Sampling Sites<br>

•The researchers selected six sampling sites along the Marikina River, including three upstream (U1, U2, U3) and three downstream (D1, D2, D3) locations to represent varying levels of urban influence and possible pollution.<br><br>


2. Water Sample Collection

Sampling Procedure:<br><br>

•At each site, grab samples of surface water were collected using sterile tubes.<br><br>

•Four samples (50 mL each) were taken per site at depths of 1–15 cm.<br><br>

•Two sampling rounds were conducted: one in early February 2024 and another in late March 2024, resulting in a total of 48 water samples.<br><br>


•Samples were placed on ice immediately and transported to the laboratory for analysis within 4 hours of collection.<br><br>


3. Microbial Quality Testing

Selective Counting of E. coli and Coliforms:<br><br>

•Water samples were diluted and plated onto 3M Petrifilm E. coli/Coliform Count Plates.<br><br>

•Plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 ± 2 hours.<br><br>

•Blue colonies with gas were counted as E. coli. All gas-producing colonies (blue or red) were counted as total coliforms.<br><br>

•Colony counts were converted to CFU (colony forming units) per 100 mL.<br><br>

4. Isolation and Purification of E. coli<br><br>

•Presumptive E. coli colonies were selected from Petrifilm plates.<br><br>

•These colonies were streaked onto Eosin Methylene Blue (EMB) agar and then onto MacConkey (MAC) agar to purify and confirm E. coli identity based on characteristic colony morphology.<br><br> 


5. Identification and Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing (AST)<br><br>

Preparatory Steps:<br><br>

•Bacterial suspensions were prepared for each isolate.<br><br>

Automated System:<br><br>

•Susceptibility testing was performed using automated and standardized systems (e.g., VITEK density and SensititreTM plates).<br><br>

Antibiotics Panel:<br><br>

•A panel of 22 antibiotics from different classes was used, including:<br><br>

•Penicillins<br><br>

•Cephalosporins<br><br>

•Carbapenems<br><br>

•Aminoglycosides<br><br>

•Quinolones<br><br>

•Polymyxins<br><br>

•Sulfonamides<br><br>

These covered both first-line and advanced antibiotics.

Data Interpretation:<br><br>

•Results were interpreted according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines to determine whether isolates were susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to each antibiotic.<br><br>


6. Classification of Resistance Profiles<br><br>

•Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) and Multidrug Resistance (MDR) were calculated based on the number of antibiotics to which each isolate was resistant.<br><br>

•Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) production was identified to assess resistance against advanced β-lactam antibiotics.<br><br>


7. Data Analysis<br><br>

•The researchers statistically analyzed E. coli and total coliform concentrations across sample sites.<br><br>

•They also compared resistance patterns between isolates from upstream vs. downstream sites.<br><br>

•Statistical tests were applied to determine significant differences and patterns in resistance distribution.<br><br>
