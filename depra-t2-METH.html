1. Site Selection & Classification<br><br>

•The researchers selected seven hawker stall locations along the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia (in Terengganu state).
<br><br>
•Sites were categorized into three environmental types: suburban, urban, and industrial.
<br><br>
•These classifications were used to compare how microplastic deposition varied with surrounding land use and pollution sources.<br><br>

2. Sampling of Airborne Microplastics<br><br>

•Dry deposition sampling was used — this captures microplastic particles that settle out of the air onto surfaces over time.
<br><br>
•Whatman glass fiber filter paper (0.2 µm pore size) was deployed in the open-air environment at each site.
<br><br>
•These filters collected particles over a fixed period (details such as duration generally specified in the full article).<br><br>

3. Laboratory Processing
<br><br>
•Once collected, samples underwent several analytical procedures:<br><br>

a. Sorting & Counting<br><br>

•Particles trapped on filters were manually separated and counted under a digital stereomicroscope to determine abundance (items per square meter per day).<br><br>

b. Morphological Characterization<br><br>

•The physical features of microplastics were recorded, including shape (e.g., fibers vs. fragments), size, and color distribution.<br><br>

c. Polymer Identification<br><br>

•ATR-FTIR (Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) was used to chemically confirm what polymers the microplastics were made of (e.g., polyester, nylon).
<br><br>
4. Data Analysis<br><br>

•Deposition fluxes were calculated (e.g., number of particles per m² per day).<br><br>

•The researchers compared microplastic abundances, shapes, colors, and polymer identities across the three different site types (suburban vs. urban vs. industrial).<br><br>

•Statistical analysis was used to determine significant differences in deposition patterns among these environments.</p>
