The researchers recommend that national health bodies like NICE and the MHRA explicitly clarify in their guidelines that eGFR and CrCl are not equivalent, mandating the use of the Cockcroft–Gault method for all DOAC dosing to prevent dangerous overestimations of renal function. To support this, they suggest that GP software suppliers should integrate standardized, automated CrCl calculators within electronic health records to streamline documentation and auditing. Furthermore, clear guidance is needed regarding which weight measurements to use for patients at extremes of body weight (under 50 kg or over 120 kg) to ensure calculation accuracy. Finally, the study emphasizes the need for urgent clinical reviews of the thousands of patients identified as receiving incorrect doses—specifically those being overdosed, which increases bleeding risks, and those being underdosed, which leaves them vulnerable to strokes.        </div>
