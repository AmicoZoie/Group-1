•Determine the differences in airborne microplastic deposition among suburban, urban, and industrial hawker stall environments along the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The study focuses on quantifying and comparing the abundance of atmospheric microplastics (AMPs) settling (dry deposition) at these different land-use types.<br><br>

•Identify the physical and chemical characteristics of deposited microplastics, including:<br><br>

-Shape (e.g., fibers vs. fragments)<br><br>

-Color<br><br>

-Polymer type (e.g., polyester, nylon), using analytical methods like ATR-FTIR spectroscopy.)<br><br>

•Provide evidence on human exposure risks — by assessing microplastic deposition rates at coastal hawker stalls, the study aims to infer potential exposure and ingestion risks for people eating or working in those open-air environments.<br><br>

•Establish baseline information on atmospheric microplastic contamination in Malaysian coastal food environments, where such data are currently limited, helping inform future air quality and public health research.</p>
