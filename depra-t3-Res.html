<p> Main Findings<br><br>

Microplastics were consistently detected in all sampled bivalve species and in surface waters from bivalve aquaculture areas, even though the overall concentrations were relatively low. <br><br>

Higher microplastic levels occurred in more anthropogenically impacted sites, indicating that human activity increases microplastic contamination in both organisms and surrounding waters.<br><br>

Fibers were the predominant type of microplastic found in both bivalves and water samples.<br><br>

The most common polymer types identified were polyamide, polyester, and polyethylene, which are typical materials from synthetic textiles and packaging. <br><br>

Interspecific differences in microplastic content were observed among the bivalve species studied—likely linked to differences in feeding behaviour or habitat—suggesting that not all species accumulate microplastics the same way. </p>
