Antibiotic resistance is a global health threat, with the widespread misuse and overuse of antibiotics in human medicine, agriculture, and industry driving the development of resistant strains of bacteria. One significant consequence of this is the presence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in the environment, particularly in water bodies. Rivers and other bodies of water are critical sources of water for human consumption, agricultural use, and recreational activities, yet they are increasingly contaminated by a variety of pollutants, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

The Marikina River in the Philippines, which flows through densely populated and industrialized areas, may be a potential site for the accumulation and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli (E. coli). E. coli is a common indicator bacterium used to assess fecal contamination in water, and the presence of antibiotic-resistant strains in this water source raises serious public health concerns. There is a lack of comprehensive research examining the antibiotic resistance profiles of E. coli strains in the Marikina River, the potential sources of contamination, and the environmental and public health risks associated with these resistant strains.
