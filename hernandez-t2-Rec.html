			<p>Colleges and universities should integrate structured mental health education, such as Abnormal Psychology or similar courses, into their curricula to improve students’ mental health awareness and reduce stigma. Institutions are encouraged to expand campus-wide mental health education programs and awareness campaigns to ensure that all students, regardless of major, have access to accurate mental health information and resources. Future research should involve larger and more diverse student populations to improve generalizability and examine the long-term effects of mental health education on help-seeking behavior. Additionally, studies should explore alternative educational interventions, including workshops, online modules, and peer-led programs, to determine the most effective strategies for reducing stigma and promoting mental health literacy among college students.</p>
