            <h2>Statement of the Problem</h2><hr>
            The statement of the problem centers on the poor quality and inconsistency of hospital discharge summaries, which are currently written by overburdened junior doctors. Because these summaries often lack critical information—such as test results and accurate medication lists—and are prone to transcription errors and confusing abbreviations, they create significant patient safety risks and hinder the continuity of care between hospitals and GPs. Despite existing frameworks for improvement, adherence remains low, and the current manual process is inefficient, time-consuming, and lacks a nationally standardized model.
