			<h2>Statement of the Problem</h2>
			<hr class="linenablue">
        <p>Environmental concern: Conventional plastics, especially single-use plastics (SUP), cause significant environmental harm including pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

Bioplastics interest: Bioplastics are increasingly proposed as alternative materials with potential sustainability advantages.

Research gap: Previous LCA studies on bioplastics show inconsistent methodologies and findings, making comparisons challenging. There is a need for a holistic review of these assessments to clarify environmental implications and future directions for sustainable bioplastic development.</p>
