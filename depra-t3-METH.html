			<h2>Methodology</h2>
			<hr class="linenablue">
<p> 1. Field Sampling of Bivalves and Water<br><br>

Collection of multiple commercial bivalve species (e.g., mussels and clams) from different coastal sites with contrasting levels of human impact (anthropized vs. less impacted areas). <br><br>

Sampling of surface water from aquaculture zones and nearby ocean waters where these bivalves live. 

2. Laboratory Preparation<br><br>

Dissection of bivalves to isolate soft tissues where microplastics accumulate (e.g., gills, digestive tract). This is standard in microplastic bioaccumulation studies. <br><br>

Pre-treatment of tissues and water samples to remove organic matter (e.g., through digestion with enzymes or chemicals) before microplastic extraction.<br><br>

3. Microplastic Extraction<br><br>

Density separation using saline or heavy solutions (e.g., NaCl or ZnCl₂) to float microplastics away from biological material. This is a common method in microplastic research to separate plastics from tissue/water matrices. <br><br>

4. Visual Isolation and Identification<br><br>

Microscopic examination under a stereo microscope to count and size microplastic particles. <br><br>

Classification of particles by shape (e.g., fibers, fragments) and color.<br><br>

5. Polymer Characterization<br><br>

Use of spectroscopic analysis such as ATR-FTIR (Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) to identify types of plastic polymers present (e.g., polyamide, polyester, polyethylene). <br><br>

6. Comparative Analysis<br><br>

Quantification of microplastic abundance in bivalves and water.<br><br>

Comparison between sites (anthropized vs. less impacted) and among species to investigate differences in microplastic load and characteristics. </p>
