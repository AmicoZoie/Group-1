			<h2>Statement of the Problem</h2>
			<hr class="linenablue">
				<div class="pabigat">
			<p>The increasing demand for flexible and wearable electronic devices requires energy storage systems that are lightweight, mechanically flexible, and environmentally sustainable. However, conventional electrode substrates such as metal foils and polymers suffer from limitations including high weight, poor mechanical durability, and weak interfacial stability under deformation.

Paper-based materials offer a promising alternative due to their flexibility, low cost, and eco-friendly nature, but their low electrical conductivity and long-term electrochemical stability remain major challenges. Despite growing research interest, existing studies are scattered and lack a comprehensive evaluation of fabrication methods, material performance, and practical limitations.</p>
