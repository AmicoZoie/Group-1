        This research investigates how advanced English learners use mobile devices to support their studies, addressing the gap between the availability of technology and the students' ability to use it for "critical adaptive learning." The study specifically aims to determine if and how students engage with smartphones and tablets to create personalized learning experiences that meet their linguistic needs.

The study involved 20 Polish university students majoring in English Philology, with proficiency levels ranging from B1 to C2. Using a mixed-methods approach, the researcher conducted semi-structured interviews to gather introspective data on the students' habits, preferred apps, and motivations for using mobile tools in both formal and informal settings.

Data were analyzed through thematic coding to identify recurring behaviors and quantitative analysis to calculate response frequencies. The final results provide insight into how experienced learners organize their own mobile learning environments and how these tools function as an addition to modern language study.
