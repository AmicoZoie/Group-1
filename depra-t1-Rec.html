<p>
The study recommends regular monitoring of the Marikina River to track microbial contamination and antibiotic resistance trends.<br><br>

Improved wastewater treatment and sanitation practices should be enforced to reduce fecal pollution and the spread of resistant bacteria.<br><br>

Proper antibiotic stewardship in human health, agriculture, and veterinary sectors is essential to limit environmental contamination.<br><br>

Public awareness campaigns should be strengthened to inform communities about the risks of exposure to contaminated river water.<br><br> 

Further research, including molecular analysis of resistance genes, is encouraged to better understand the sources and transmission of antibiotic resistance.
