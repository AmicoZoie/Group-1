        <p>What the study aimed to do:
This research aimed to develop eco-friendly and sustainable bioplastics from cassava starch and to tailor their mechanical and biodegradation properties through the addition of nanoparticles (silver and zinc oxide). The ultimate goal was to create value-added biodegradable products such as carry bags and garbage bags that could serve as environmentally preferable alternatives to conventional plastics.
