			<hr class="linenablue">
<p>
 •The main goal of the study was to:<br><br>

 •Determine the differences in airborne microplastic (AMP) abundance and distribution at open-air hawker stalls in suburban, urban, and industrial coastal areas in Peninsular Malaysia, and to:
<br><br>
 •Characterize the physical (shape, color) and chemical (polymer type) properties of airborne microplastics collected in these environments.
<br><br>
 •This addresses an important gap in understanding microplastics in outdoor atmospheric environments and food-related exposure settings.
