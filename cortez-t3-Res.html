            <h2>Results</h2><hr>
The results reveal a significant surge in DOAC use and a gradual improvement in clinical monitoring, though notable gaps in safety data remain. From January 2018 to February 2023, DOAC prescribing increased by 82.6%, with the majority of patients being males over the age of 70. By February 2023, while over 92% of patients had creatinine and eGFR recorded, only 72.8% had a recorded weight and 73.5% had a recorded CrCl. Encouragingly, there was a 42% increase in CrCl recording between July 2022 and February 2023, which allowed for better dose monitoring. Among patients with atrial fibrillation, dose accuracy improved slightly to 86.2%; however, 13.8% of patients were still receiving non-recommended doses, with underdosing (11.1%) being far more common than overdosing (2.7%).        </div>
