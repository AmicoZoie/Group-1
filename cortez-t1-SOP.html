        <p>Despite the rapid proliferation of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, there remains a critical need to understand how these technologies are effectively integrated into language acquisition. While these tools offer "virtually limitless" opportunities for individualized learning and easy access to resources (Byrne & Diem, 2014; Reinders & White, 2016), their mere presence does not guarantee educational success.

The problem lies in the disconnect between the availability of technology and the learners' ability to use these tools for "critical adaptive learning." As noted by Reinders and White (2016), technology-mediated autonomy must be better aligned with the specific tools and settings that language learners find significant. Furthermore, while teachers are encouraged to equip students with the knowledge to use these affordances, there is a lack of empirical data regarding how learners actually organize their own learning environments in these contexts.

Consequently, there is a need to investigate the specific modalities of mobile device usage among high-level learners. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the ways in which advanced English language students utilize their mobile devices (specifically smartphones and tablet computers) for their language learning processes.</p>
