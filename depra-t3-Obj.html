<p>Primary Objective<br><br>

To investigate microplastic pollution by measuring the presence, types, and characteristics of microplastics in both commercially important bivalve species and in surface waters from bivalve aquaculture zones in the southern Pacific. 
<br><br>

 Secondary/Specific Aims<br><br>

To compare microplastic concentrations in bivalves and aquaculture waters from areas with different levels of human (anthropogenic) impact. <br><br>

To characterize the types of microplastics (e.g., polymer types and physical forms such as fibers) present in both biological and environmental samples. <br><br>

To provide insights useful for monitoring and mitigation strategies, highlighting the need to monitor microplastics in aquaculture and possibly inform management practices.  </p>
