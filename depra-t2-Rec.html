<p>•Conduct Further Research on Health and Exposure Risks
The study highlights that people frequenting open-air hawker stalls are likely exposed to atmospheric microplastics and may ingest them due to dry deposition onto food and surfaces. This suggests a need for additional research to understand human exposure pathways and potential health implications of inhaled/ingested microplastics, especially among populations with high exposure rates.<br><br>

•Expand Monitoring Across Different Land-Use and Coastal Areas
Because this was the first report on airborne microplastic contamination at coastal hawker stalls, the authors would likely recommend broader atmospheric microplastic monitoring in other coastal regions, different types of environments, and multiple seasons to better characterize spatial and temporal patterns.<br><br>

•Implement Standardized Sampling and Characterization Methods
The study’s methodology (dry deposition using glass filters and ATR-FTIR polymer identification) provides a solid baseline, but expanding and standardizing methods across studies would improve comparability and trends analysis globally.<br><br>

•Raise Public Awareness and Food Safety Practices
Given the potential for microplastics to deposit directly onto food at open-air stalls, the authors likely recommend raising awareness among vendors and consumers about microplastic contamination and encouraging practices that minimize direct deposition onto food (e.g., protective covers, changing handling practices).<br><br>

•Target Policy and Environmental Management Interventions
The identification of petrochemical fibers (PET and nylon) as dominant microplastics indicates links with textiles, packaging, and urban/industrial emissions. Authors would likely suggest policy measures and waste management strategies aimed at reducing primary sources of airborne microplastics—such as improved plastic waste control, textile industry regulations, and emission mitigation.<br><br>

•Integrate Microplastic Considerations Into Air Quality Standards
As microplastics become recognized as a component of atmospheric pollution, the authors may recommend incorporating microplastic deposition into air quality monitoring frameworks and environmental standards, particularly in urban and industrial coastal zones. </p>
