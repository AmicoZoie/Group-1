This study centers on the safety risks associated with the mass transition of patients from warfarin to DOACs during the COVID-19 pandemic. While DOACs are more convenient, they pose a significant risk of fatal bleeding if not dosed correctly based on specific renal metrics. The core issue is that many clinicians in England rely on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to assess kidney function, but national guidelines explicitly require the Cockcroft–Gault method (CrCl) for DOAC dosing because eGFR can overestimate renal health and lead to dangerously high doses. This study addresses the concern that essential clinical data—such as weight and calculated CrCl—may not be adequately recorded in patient records, potentially compromising safety for those on long-term anticoagulation.
