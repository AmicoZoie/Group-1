			<p>The reviewed studies show that Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation is a multi-stage process regulated by complex genetic and environmental mechanisms. Biofilms provide structural protection through an extracellular matrix that enhances bacterial survival and significantly increases resistance to antibiotics and host immune responses. Key regulatory systems, including quorum sensing and global transcriptional regulators, play crucial roles in biofilm development, maturation, and dispersal. The findings also indicate that biofilm-associated infections are more persistent and difficult to eradicate than planktonic infections, underscoring the importance of targeting biofilm regulation pathways to improve antibiotic effectiveness and infection control.</p>
