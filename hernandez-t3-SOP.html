			<h2>Statement of the Problem</h2>
			<hr class="linenablue">
			<p>Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of persistent and difficult-to-treat infections, largely due to its ability to form biofilms. Biofilm-associated infections show increased resistance to antibiotics and host immune responses, leading to treatment failure, prolonged illness, and higher healthcare costs. Despite extensive research, the molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways involved in S. aureus biofilm formation are complex and not yet fully understood. Existing studies are scattered across different regulatory systems, genetic factors, and environmental conditions, making it challenging to develop effective antibiofilm and antibiotic strategies. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive review that systematically examines the biofilm formation process of S. aureus, its regulatory mechanisms, and its role in antibiotic resistance to support the development of improved therapeutic approaches.</p>
