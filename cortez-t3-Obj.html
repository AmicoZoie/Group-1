          <ul>
            <li>Analyze Prescribing Trends: To describe the shifts in direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) prescribing patterns following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic using the OpenSAFELY-TPP platform.</li>

<li>Evaluate Clinical Record Completeness: To determine the proportion of patients prescribed a DOAC who have essential clinical parameters recorded in their electronic health records, specifically:</li>
<ul>
<li>Body weight</li>

<li>Serum creatinine</li>

<li>Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)</li>

<li>Creatinine clearance (CrCl)</li>
</ul>
<li>Assess Guideline Adherence: To identify if these clinical parameters are being recorded in accordance with national recommendations for calculating accurate DOAC doses.</li>

<li>Identify Patient Safety Risks: To investigate whether the use of eGFR (which can overestimate renal function) instead of the recommended Cockcroft–Gault method (CrCl) is contributing to inappropriate dosing and increased bleeding risks.</li>

<li>Examine Specific Patient Groups: To look at recording rates and dosing accuracy specifically in high-risk groups, such as individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) who require long-term anticoagulation.</li>
</ul>
