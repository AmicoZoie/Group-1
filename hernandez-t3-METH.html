			<h2>Methodology</h2>
			<hr class="linenablue">
			<p>This study employed a narrative literature review approach to synthesize existing research on Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation and its regulatory mechanisms. Peer-reviewed journal articles, review papers, and authoritative scientific reports were collected from academic databases such as PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Google Scholar.

Relevant literature was identified using keywords including Staphylococcus aureus, biofilm formation, biofilm regulation, antibiotic resistance, and antibiofilm strategies. Selected studies were screened based on their relevance to biofilm structure, formation stages, genetic and molecular regulatory pathways, and implications for antibiotic resistance.

The gathered literature was systematically analyzed and organized into thematic areas, including biofilm development stages, extracellular matrix components, regulatory systems, and clinical relevance. Findings were critically evaluated to identify research gaps and highlight potential targets for future antibiofilm and therapeutic strategies.</p>
