The study concludes that advanced English learners are increasingly adopting smartphones as essential, autonomous tools for language study, primarily due to the convenience and efficiency they offer in managing vocabulary and digital resources. While 75% of the participants reported that mobile technology makes their learning more effective and time-efficient, their engagement remains largely informal and ad hoc, with a significant focus on vocabulary at the expense of other language skills like grammar or listening. Interestingly, despite being advanced students, nearly half expressed a lack of confidence in their ability to use these devices skillfully for educational purposes. This suggests that while students are motivated to use technology, their practices are often superficial and lack the "critical adaptive learning" necessary to fully exploit the affordances of mobile devices in a formal academic context.

To address these gaps, it is recommended that language practitioners actively bridge the divide between students’ informal habits and formal classroom instruction. Teachers should move beyond passive acceptance of mobile devices and instead intentionally integrate mobile-mediated tasks into the curriculum, such as using specialized apps for collaborative projects or high-level skill development. Furthermore, institutions should provide explicit digital literacy training to help learners move from an intuitive, ad hoc usage toward a more strategic and sophisticated approach to mobile learning. By offering curated recommendations for diverse tools—such as podcasts for listening or mobile-based writing aids—and designing tasks that leverage the "mobility" of these devices, educators can help students transform their smartphones from simple digital dictionaries into comprehensive, multi-dimensional learning environments.</p>
