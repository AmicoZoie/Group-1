        <p>While this specific article (Development of eco-friendly bioplastics with nanoparticles) does not explicitly list formal recommendations in the abstract, based on the research findings we can deduce the following recommendations for future work and applications:

Practical Recommendations

Optimize nanoparticle types and concentrations to balance mechanical strength and biodegradability for specific end uses.

Further evaluate long-term environmental fate, including toxicity and nano-particle release risks in ecosystems.

Scale up production testing to assess industrial feasibility for commercial packaging products.

Life cycle and economic analysis to compare these bioplastics to conventional plastics across sustainability metrics.
(These inferred recommendations align with research logic given the findings and broader bioplastics literature.)</p>
