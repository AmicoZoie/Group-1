Mechanical Properties

Nanoparticle addition (especially at 1% concentration) enhanced mechanical strength:

Maximum tensile strength with ZnO nanoparticles was ~4.80 N/mm².

With Ag nanoparticles, tensile strength was ~4.33 N/mm².

Nanoparticles did not significantly change the thermal stability of the bioplastics.

Biodegradation Behavior

Soil degradation increased when nanoparticles were present — indicating enhanced biodegradability in terrestrial environments.

Air and water degradation showed that nanoparticle-incorporated samples degraded more slowly than pure bioplastics under those conditions.

Functional Suitability

The tailored bioplastics showed improved mechanical and degradation properties over pure cassava starch bioplastics, suggesting they’re better candidates for practical applications such as carry bags and garbage bags.
