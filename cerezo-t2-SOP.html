        <p>Problem / Context

Conventional plastics cause growing environmental concerns due to persistence in the environment and pollution.

Biopolymers like starch have inherent limitations in application due to poor mechanical strength and high water affinity.

There is a need for sustainable bioplastics with improved functional properties to serve in real-world applications like packaging.

Scope

Focus was on cassava starch as a biopolymer base due to its low cost, abundant availability, renewable nature, and biodegradability.

The study explored adding nanoparticles (Ag and ZnO) to customize bioplastic properties — improving strength while assessing effects on biodegradation.
