 Microbial Contamination Levels<br><br>
•Escherichia coli concentrations at all six sampling sites along the Marikina River far exceeded safe microbial limits set for beneficial water use (even for Class D water, which already has high permissible contamination limits).<br><br>


•The average E. coli concentration across all sites was about 1.9 × 10⁵ CFU/100 mL, and total coliforms averaged 12.0 × 10⁵ CFU/100 mL—both well above acceptable standards.<br><br> 


•Even in areas within a protected landscape (where contamination would be expected to be lower), E. coli and coliform levels (1.5 × 10³ and 5.6 × 10³ CFU/100 mL, respectively) were still above the Class A water limit of 100 CFU/100 mL.<br><br>


 Antibiotic Resistance Findings<br><br>

•Multidrug resistance (MDR): About 18.8 % of the E. coli isolates were classified as multidrug-resistant, meaning they were resistant to multiple antibiotics.<br><br>


•Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producers: Around 22.9 % of isolates produced ESBL enzymes, which confer resistance to a broad range of β-lactam antibiotics (including penicillins and cephalosporins).<br><br> 


•Resistance in upstream areas: Some E. coli isolates from the most upstream sampling sites showed resistance to third-generation cephalosporins—a class of antibiotics commonly used for serious infections—suggesting that resistance is present even before the river passes through densely populated or urbanized areas.<br><br>
