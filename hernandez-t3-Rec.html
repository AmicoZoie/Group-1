			<p>It is necessary to further study the formation and regulation mechanism of S. aureus biofilm for research and development of anti-biofilm drugs that inhibit biofilm formation. The process of biofilm formation is complex and involves the co-expression of multiple genes. S. aureus relies on a broad network of regulatory systems that coordinate biofilm formation in a complementary or opposing way. At present, although progress has been made in the regulatory mechanism of the formation of S. aureus biofilm, researchers have not yet understood the synergy between different regulatory networks. Moreover, the regulation mechanism of biofilm is dynamic. For example, different growth times and different environments may have different regulatory genes. How to realize these signals thus needs further investigation. At the same time, little is known about whether the regulation mechanism of biofilm in vivo is the same as in vitro. Human organoid models may be one of the most exciting tools to understand the regulation mechanism of S. aureus biofilm. On the other hand, the experimental results of reference strains may not be similar to the results of clinical isolates. The results obtained from reference strains may have some differences from that of clinical isolates. Therefore, different clinical isolates can be used for further research to provide better clinical significance. In addition, in clinical infection, S. aureus can also form mixed species biofilm with other bacteria and/or fungi. It is also important to include mixed species biofilm in the study.</p>
