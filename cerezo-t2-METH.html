      <p>Materials and Formulation

Cassava starch was used with a cassava starch : plasticizer ratio of 1 : 0.05 optimized for mechanical performance.

Silver (Ag) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles were synthesized by green methods and added to bioplastic formulations at varying concentrations.

Characterization Techniques

Nanoparticle characterization: X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).

Mechanical testing: Tensile strength measurements.

Biodegradation studies: Conducted in soil, air, and water environments for 31 days to evaluate degradation behavior.</p>
