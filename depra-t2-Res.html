• First study of its kind at coastal hawker stalls<br><br>

This research measured how microplastics (tiny plastic particles <5 mm) settle out of the air (dry deposition) in different environments around hawker stalls — suburban, urban, and industrial coastal areas.<br><br>

• Abundance & distribution of airborne microplastics<br><br>

Microplastic deposition rates varied widely across locations, ranging from about 0.48 to 17.44 particles per square meter per day.<br><br>

This indicates people visiting or working at these coastal hawker stalls are likely exposed to microplastics in the air around them.<br><br>

• Types of microplastics identified<br><br>

The majority of airborne microplastics were fibers, far more common than fragments.<br><br>

Among polymers identified:<br><br>

PET (polyester) was dominant (~81 %)<br><br>

Nylon (polyamide) was also present (~5 %)<br><br>

•Physical characteristics<br><br>

Transparent microplastic fibers were the most commonly found, followed by black, purple, and brown fibers. </p>
