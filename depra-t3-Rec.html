<p> 1. Enhance Monitoring Programs<br><br>

The authors recommend establishing or strengthening regular monitoring of microplastics in both bivalve organisms and aquaculture waters to better understand spatial and temporal trends in contamination, especially across areas with varying levels of human impact. <br><br>

2. Develop Mitigation Strategies<br><br>

They stress the importance of developing mitigation strategies to reduce microplastic pollution in aquaculture systems and the surrounding marine environment, in order to protect ecosystem health and seafood safety. <br><br>

3. Focus on Sources of Pollution<br><br>

Given that higher microplastic concentrations were observed in more anthropogenically impacted sites, the study implies a need to identify and manage local sources of plastic inputs (e.g., urban runoff, wastewater, fishing gear, aquaculture materials) to lower contamination levels. <br><br>

4. Consider Species‑Specific Differences<br><br>

Because interspecific differences in microplastic accumulation were found, the authors suggest that species‑specific traits should be considered when designing monitoring and risk assessment protocols. </p>
