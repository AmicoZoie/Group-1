			<h2>Objectives</h2>
			<hr class="linenablue">
			<ul>
				<li>To review recent advances in paper-based electroactive materials used for flexible and sustainable energy storage applications, particularly in wearable and portable electronics.</li>
				<li> To classify and analyze paper-based electrode architectures, specifically paper-supported electrodes and freestanding paper-like structures, highlighting their structural and functional differences.</li>
				<li>To examine fabrication strategies and material design approaches for paper-based electrodes, including direct loading, in situ growth, and composite engineering techniques.</li>
				<li>To evaluate the electrochemical performance of paper-based energy storage devices, with particular emphasis on paper-based supercapacitors, considering metrics such as energy density, power density, flexibility, and cycling stability.</li>
				<li>To assess the role of cellulose and carbon-based materials (e.g., graphene, CNTs, carbon fibers, and cellulose nanofibers) in enhancing mechanical flexibility, conductivity, and charge storage capability.</li>
