			<h2>Recommendations</h2>
			<hr class="linenablue">
			<p>Future research should focus on improving the electrical conductivity and mechanical durability of paper-based electrodes through advanced material compositing, surface functionalization, and structural engineering. Efforts should also be directed toward enhancing long-term cycling stability and performance under repeated mechanical deformation. Additionally, scalable, low-cost, and environmentally friendly fabrication methods should be explored to enable practical commercialization. Further studies integrating paper-based energy storage devices into real wearable and flexible electronic systems are recommended to evaluate their reliability and real-world applicability.</p>
